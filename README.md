*Background and Release of Album*
---
After graduating from Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, where she studied studio compositions and released her first two albums as student projects, Mitski learned to play the guitar and began work on her third studio album. The projects, combined with completing her degree while working outside jobs to pay rent, left Mitski exhausted, a state which heavily influenced the creation of the album. The album was recorded mostly in houses and makeshift studios with a select group of musicians and friends and represented a departure from Mitski's classical training showcased in her orchestral, piano-based first two albums.

The lead single of the album, ["First Love / Late Spring"](https://youtu.be/WCphVz0ZGns?feature=shared), was released on May 15, 2014, with Double Double Whammy announcing Mitski joined their label roster and will release a full-length record later that year. The album was announced on September 16 alongside the release of the second single, "Townie". Two music videos were released for "Townie", the first directed by Allyssa Yohana and premiered on Rookie on November 9, 2014,[14] and the second directed by Faye Orlove and premiered on The Fader on March 9, 2015. She released two more singles, "I Don't Smoke" on September 29 and "I Will" on October 21.

The album was reissued with four new bonus tracks on April 7, 2015, through Don Giovanni Records.In 2016, the album was released under Mitski's new label Dead Oceans.
