2012–2014: Lush; Retired from Sad, New Career in Business; and Bury Me at Makeout Creek
After enrolling at Hunter College to study film, Mitski decided to pursue music instead and transferred to SUNY Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, where she studied studio composition. During her time at Purchase, she recorded and self-released her piano-based first and second albums, Lush (2012) and Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013), as student projects. While there, Mitski met Patrick Hyland, who has produced her albums after Lush. In 2013, she collaborated with indie-rock artists Mike Rasimas and Mutsawashe Mangwendeza, providing vocals for the original song Ego and a cover of "Nightcall" by Kavinsky.

After graduating, she served as the vocalist for the short-lived prog-metal band Voice Coilsand began work on her third studio album, Bury Me at Makeout Creek, which was released on November 11, 2014, through Double Double Whammy. The album was reissued with four bonus tracks on April 7, 2015, through Don Giovanni Records. The album's raw, impulsive guitar represented a sonic departure from the orchestral and classical piano sounds of her first two albums. It garnered acclaim from numerous publications. However, it failed to become a significant commercial success.
